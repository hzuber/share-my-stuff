Share-My-Stuff is a React app which allows you to loan out your items and keep track of who has what. 
The goal is to create communities, where people can request to borrow items from the people in their community. 
Each community should have the area with regular items and another with books. 
I plan to implement the google books API to make adding books easier. 

At the moment there is no secure authentication, but it will check for the users correct password and 
email at login. 

If you don't wish to create an account, and just want to play around, sign in with 
email hannahzuber@email.com and password password1.
